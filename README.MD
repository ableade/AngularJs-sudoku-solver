Fill in the grid with any valid starting sudoku configuration and then press the solve button to generate a correct solution. The application uses a simple backtracking algorithm and search pruning to generate the final answer. Official sudoku puzzles typically have one valid solution but it is possible to have more than one for many configurations. Our implementation stops once any valid solution is encountered.
